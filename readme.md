### Phrase grammar sentence generator

This repository generates sentences based on a defined Phrase grammar.
In short, it calculates possible derivations for a start phrase and chooses the desired ones until all variables turn to non-terminals or no more rules can be applied.
The generated abstract sentence may then be instantiazied by replacing Non-Terminals with pre-defined words from the Dictionary.

Works with:
- context free grammars
- context sensitive grammars
